# Smart Car Parking System
## Aim:
The aim of this project is to create an automatic car parking system using 8051 microcontroller.
## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop an intelligent, user friendly automated car parking system which reduces the manpower and traffic congestion.

## Methodology:
● Development and Discussion of Idea. <br />
● Writing **C** language code in **keil software**.  <br />
● Designing the circuit in **proteus software** and adding hex file to the 8051 micro-controller. <br />
● Simulation of circuit on **proteus software.** <br />

## Relevence:
● This project has simple and small circuit which is very easy to be accomodate. <br />
● The circuit is compact and fully automatic. <br />
● It required less number of components and its cheap. <br />
● It required low maintanence cost. <br />
● It does not require any man power. <br />

## Applications:
● This project can be used for  parking system in any  shopping mall, multiplex.<br />
● Can be used for industries,  commercial offices and  educational institutes.<br />
